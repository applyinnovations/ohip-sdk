  description: "APIs to cater for Reservation functionality in OPERA Cloud. <br /><br\
    \ />OPERA Cloud Reservations provides a complete set of capabilities for creating\
    \ and updating reservations. Reservations are a central feature of OPERA Cloud.\
    \ As a key source of information, the reservation specifies a guest&apos;s arrival\
    \ date, departure date, room type, rate, packages, and many other details. It\
    \ is also a gateway to dozens of other functions that contribute to the guest&apos;s\
    \ experience.  All reservations in OPERA Cloud require a guest profile.<br /><br\
    \ /> You can create profiles while booking a reservation. If a profile already\
    \ exists, you can look it up (using getProfiles in the Customer Relationship Management\
    \ module) and attach it to the reservation during the reservation booking process\
    \ using the profileId.<br /><br /> Compatible with OPERA Cloud release 23.2.<br\
