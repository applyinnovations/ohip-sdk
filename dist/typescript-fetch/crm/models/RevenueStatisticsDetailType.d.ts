There are different types of profiles in OPERA Cloud, including Guest, Company, Travel Agent, Source, Group, and Contact profile types.  A profile can store and display a wide range of information about the guest, company, travel agent etc., depending upon the type of profile.  For example, a guest profile can store the guest name, address, contact information, details on billing, membership benefits, preferences and much more.
