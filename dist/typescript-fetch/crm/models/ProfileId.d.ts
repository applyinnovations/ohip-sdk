/**
 * OPERA Cloud Customer Relationship Management API
 * APIs to cater for Customer Relationship Management (profile) functionality in OPERA Cloud.  There are different types of profiles in OPERA Cloud, including Guest, Company, Travel Agent, Source, Group, and Contact profile types.  A profile can store and display a wide range of information about the guest, company, travel agent etc., depending upon the type of profile.  For example, a guest profile can store the guest name, address, contact information, details on billing, membership benefits, preferences and much more.  All profiles in OPERA when created are assigned a ProfileID.  This ID will be used throughout the CRM APIs.<br /><br /> Compatible with OPERA Cloud release 24.4.<br /><br /><p> This document and all content within is available under the Universal Permissive License v 1.0 (https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl).
