 * OPERA Cloud Customer Relationship Management API
 * APIs to cater for Customer Relationship Management (profile) functionality in OPERA Cloud.  There are different types of profiles in OPERA Cloud, including Guest, Company, Travel Agent, Source, Group, and Contact profile types.  A profile can store and display a wide range of information about the guest, company, travel agent etc., depending upon the type of profile.  For example, a guest profile can store the guest name, address, contact information, details on billing, membership benefits, preferences and much more.
