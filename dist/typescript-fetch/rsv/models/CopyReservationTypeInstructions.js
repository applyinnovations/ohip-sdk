/**
 * OPERA Cloud Reservation API
 * APIs to cater for Reservation functionality in OPERA Cloud. <br /><br />OPERA Cloud Reservations provides a complete set of capabilities for creating and updating reservations. Reservations are a central feature of OPERA Cloud. As a key source of information, the reservation specifies a guest&apos;s arrival date, departure date, room type, rate, packages, and many other details. It is also a gateway to dozens of other functions that contribute to the guest&apos;s experience.  All reservations in OPERA Cloud require a guest profile.<br /><br /> You can create profiles while booking a reservation. If a profile already exists, you can look it up (using getProfiles in the Customer Relationship Management module) and attach it to the reservation during the reservation booking process using the profileId.<br /><br /> Compatible with OPERA Cloud release 24.4.<br /><br /><p> This document and all content within is available under the Universal Permissive License v 1.0 (https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl).
