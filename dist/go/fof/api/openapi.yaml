      description: "API that manages requests for Door Lock Room Keys. This operation\
        \ is used by OPERA Cloud PMS connected to external Door Lock Systems systems\
        \ via Outbound Systems configuration: \n\n<strong>OPERA Cloud utilizes this\
        \ operation </strong>\n\n- to request new or additional room keys - e.g. when\
        \ guest checks in, or additional keys post check in.\n\n- to request to activate\
        \ new keys after check on e.g. when a room key has been lost for a room.\n\
        \n- to request a room key which is not related to a guest reservation but\
        \ valid for a defined time - (for show rooms, repair) - One Shot Key.\n\n\
        - to request to re-encode a key whereby other keys for this room remain active.\n\
        \n- to request to read a key data from a room key and display it to the user\
        \ in the PMS.\n\n- to request to modify existing key data - upon room move\
        \ or change of departure date. (online key systems only!!)\n\n- to request\
        \ to remove / delete a room key from a room on. Usually sent with check out\
        \ of a reservation.\n\nUse this API to post a room key action to the active\
        \ Door Lock System.\n\n<strong>Notes on keyType values:</strong>\n\n<strong>keyType\
        \ = New\n\nkeyType = Lost </strong>\n\nIt is expected that all previous active\
        \ keys for the room will become invalid.\n\nIt is expected that partner system\
        \ handles multiple keys being active in case numberOfKeys is >1.\n\n<strong>keyType\
        \ = Duplicate\n\nkeyType = ReEncode</strong>\n\nIt is expected that existing\
        \ active keys for this room remain active.\n\n<strong>keyType = OneShot</strong>\n\
        \nIt is expected that the room key is only valid for a room for specific time\
        \ (for maintenance or Show room).\n\nIt is never related to a reservation.\n\
        \n<strong>keyType = Read</strong> A request to the Key Card system to read\
        \ Key Card information from requested Key Encoder/reader.\n\nThe Key Read\
        \ functionality is of pure informational purpose. None of the received information\
        \ is stored or processed in the PMS, and it is only for display to the user.\n\
        \n<strong>keyType = Remove</strong>\n\nIt is expected that with this request\
        \ all active keys for a room or reservation will become inactive or invalid\
        \ so they will not be able to open the room after defined validityEnd time.\n\
        \n<strong>Additional KeyType actions used by Online Door Lock Systems:</strong>\n\
        \n<strong>Online Key card Systems</strong> are systems which do not write\
        \ guest data to the room key directly but do store guest data internally and\
        \ send the information to the related door lock.\n\n<strong>keyType = ModifyStay</strong>\n\
        \nFor Online Door Lock Systems - Request to adjust Room key data when guest\
        \ changes length of stay (validityEnd)\n\n<strong>keyType = RoomMove</strong>\n\
        \nFor Online Door Lock Systems - adjust Room key data when guest performs\
        \ room move. \n\n<p><strong>OperationId:</strong> postExternalRoomKeys</p>"

      description: "API that manages requests for Door Lock Room Keys. This operation\
        \ is used by OPERA Cloud PMS connected to external Door Lock Systems systems\
        \ via Outbound Systems configuration: \n\n<strong>OPERA Cloud utilizes this\
        \ operation </strong>\n\n- to request new or additional room keys - e.g. when\
        \ guest checks in, or additional keys post check in.\n\n- to request to activate\
        \ new keys after check on e.g. when a room key has been lost for a room.\n\
        \n- to request a room key which is not related to a guest reservation but\
        \ valid for a defined time - (for show rooms, repair) - One Shot Key.\n\n\
        - to request to re-encode a key whereby other keys for this room remain active.\n\
        \n- to request to read a key data from a room key and display it to the user\
        \ in the PMS.\n\n- to request to modify existing key data - upon room move\
        \ or change of departure date. (online key systems only!!)\n\n- to request\
        \ to remove / delete a room key from a room on. Usually sent with check out\
        \ of a reservation.\n\nUse this API to post a room key action to the active\
        \ Door Lock System.\n\n<strong>Notes on keyType values:</strong>\n\n<strong>keyType\
        \ = New\n\nkeyType = Lost </strong>\n\nIt is expected that all previous active\
        \ keys for the room will become invalid.\n\nIt is expected that partner system\
        \ handles multiple keys being active in case numberOfKeys is >1.\n\n<strong>keyType\
        \ = Duplicate\n\nkeyType = ReEncode</strong>\n\nIt is expected that existing\
        \ active keys for this room remain active.\n\n<strong>keyType = OneShot</strong>\n\
        \nIt is expected that the room key is only valid for a room for specific time\
        \ (for maintenance or Show room).\n\nIt is never related to a reservation.\n\
        \n<strong>keyType = Read</strong> A request to the Key Card system to read\
        \ Key Card information from requested Key Encoder/reader.\n\nThe Key Read\
        \ functionality is of pure informational purpose. None of the received information\
        \ is stored or processed in the PMS, and it is only for display to the user.\n\
        \n<strong>keyType = Remove</strong>\n\nIt is expected that with this request\
        \ all active keys for a room or reservation will become inactive or invalid\
        \ so they will not be able to open the room after defined validityEnd time.\n\
        \n<strong>Additional KeyType actions used by Online Door Lock Systems:</strong>\n\
        \n<strong>Online Key card Systems</strong> are systems which do not write\
        \ guest data to the room key directly but do store guest data internally and\
        \ send the information to the related door lock.\n\n<strong>keyType = ModifyStay</strong>\n\
        \nFor Online Door Lock Systems - Request to adjust Room key data when guest\
        \ changes length of stay (validityEnd)\n\n<strong>keyType = RoomMove</strong>\n\
        \nFor Online Door Lock Systems - adjust Room key data when guest performs\
        \ room move. \n\n<p><strong>OperationId:</strong> postRoomKeysExternal</p>"

ORACLE PMS will NOT send another Request command automatically should a negative response be received. The user sees the response and decides if another try should be made.<p>
