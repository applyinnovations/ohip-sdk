## Methods

### NewMembershipTypeRuleIDType

`func NewMembershipTypeRuleIDType() *MembershipTypeRuleIDType`

NewMembershipTypeRuleIDType instantiates a new MembershipTypeRuleIDType object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewMembershipTypeRuleIDTypeWithDefaults

`func NewMembershipTypeRuleIDTypeWithDefaults() *MembershipTypeRuleIDType`

NewMembershipTypeRuleIDTypeWithDefaults instantiates a new MembershipTypeRuleIDType object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetMembershipType

`func (o *MembershipTypeRuleIDType) GetMembershipType() string`

GetMembershipType returns the MembershipType field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetMembershipTypeOk

`func (o *MembershipTypeRuleIDType) GetMembershipTypeOk() (*string, bool)`

GetMembershipTypeOk returns a tuple with the MembershipType field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetMembershipType

`func (o *MembershipTypeRuleIDType) SetMembershipType(v string)`

SetMembershipType sets MembershipType field to given value.

### HasMembershipType

`func (o *MembershipTypeRuleIDType) HasMembershipType() bool`

HasMembershipType returns a boolean if a field has been set.

### GetMembershipPointsSequence

`func (o *MembershipTypeRuleIDType) GetMembershipPointsSequence() int32`

GetMembershipPointsSequence returns the MembershipPointsSequence field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetMembershipPointsSequenceOk

`func (o *MembershipTypeRuleIDType) GetMembershipPointsSequenceOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetMembershipPointsSequenceOk returns a tuple with the MembershipPointsSequence field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetMembershipPointsSequence

`func (o *MembershipTypeRuleIDType) SetMembershipPointsSequence(v int32)`

SetMembershipPointsSequence sets MembershipPointsSequence field to given value.

### HasMembershipPointsSequence

`func (o *MembershipTypeRuleIDType) HasMembershipPointsSequence() bool`

HasMembershipPointsSequence returns a boolean if a field has been set.
